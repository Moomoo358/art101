			<h1>Lab 3 File Structure</h1>
			<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p> The only difficulties that I had encounterd during this lab was the resizing of my photo. No matter what I did to try and fix it, it would not allow an altering of the image.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> Well you are looking at the index.html file I created. Here is the file structure that I made.</p>
