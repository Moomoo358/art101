          <h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
          <p> Working by myself, experimented with anonymous functions and
            callbacks.</p>
          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p> I had to experiment a bit with the console. I was confused about the function.
              I managed to figure it out, but functions do still confuse me a bit.</p>
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p> Go to the console to see the output.
            Sike! The output will appear here.</p>

          <div id="output">
            Original array: [2, 34, 23, 5, 67, 12];
            Multiplied by 2:[4, 8, 10, 134, 16, 112];
            Multipled by the third power: 8, 64, 125, 300763, 512, 175616];
