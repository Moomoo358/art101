			<h1> Lab 14: Debugging Tools and Strategies</h1>
			<h2> Challenges</h2>
			<p> Working with my partner, experimented with debugging past labs</p>
			<h2> Problems</h2>
			<p> There are no problems so far</p>
			<h2> Results</h2>
			<p> Looked at the past labs and found which one I had messed up on or
			did not finish.</p>

			<h3>Debugging</h3>
			<p> An issue that I had found in a previous lab was lab 3. I
				been unable to change the size of my photos. According to my lab, I
				had tried numerous ways to fix it and could not figure out the problem.
				I discovered that the issue I had with the sizing was not adding 'px'
				to the end of the number for the size! The smallest mistake. The
				pictures below show the change that I made and how I wanted my lab 3 to
				look when I first attempted it.</p>
