			<h1> Lab 9: Javascript for the Web</h1>
			<p> Working with my partner, experimented with DOM manipulation</p>
			<h2> Challenges</h2>
			<p> The javascript was the most challenging. Mine appeared at the bottom of the page
				and I am not exactly sure why. I also could not figure out how to put it within
			my current border. My partner had trouble with her javascrpt code, even though it lookedd
			similar to mine. </p>
			<h2> Results</h2>
			<p> Well you are looking at the index.html file I created.</p>

			<div id= "output"
				<h2> Script Output</h2>
				<p> The results are at the bottom of the page</p>
